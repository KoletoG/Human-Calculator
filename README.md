# HumanCalculator

Human Calculator is a project / game where you learn and test the speed of your mathematical multiplication ability. 
Right now there is only 1 level in which you calculate two two-digit numbers.
The program saves your score on a .txt file on your computer with the text content of your nickname, score and the average time taken to make the calculations.


The whole idea of this project was to test interfaces :O
